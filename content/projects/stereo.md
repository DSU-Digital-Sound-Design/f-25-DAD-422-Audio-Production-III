title: "Project 2: Binaural/Stereo"
---

## Project Overview

In this project, you will create a one-minute piece of binaural music, sound design, or narrative fiction that demonstrates your understanding of binaural and stereo recording techniques. The piece can either stand alone or accompany a visual, but the primary focus is on spatial audio and the use of stereo and binaural methods to create an immersive sound experience.

## Requirements

**Track 1: Stereo Recording Technique**
* Use one stereo microphone recording technique learned in class (e.g., XY, ORTF, or Mid-Side). This will represent one track of your project and should be an original recording made for this project.

**Track 2: Binaural Recording**

* Use the Zoom H3-VR in binaural mode to record an environment, voice, or sound source. This will represent another track in your project and should be an original recording.

**All other tracks: Mono Sources Spatialized with Anaglyph**

* All other sound sources (such as ambient sounds or dialogue) can be recorded in mono and spatialized using the Anaglyph plugin for binaural spatialization. These should be original recordings. For inspiration, explore other projects created with Anaglyph: [http://anaglyph.dalembert.upmc.fr/page-gallery.html](http://anaglyph.dalembert.upmc.fr/page-gallery.html)

**Panning Automation**

* Integrate at least two panning automation moves in your project. One of these should simulate a dynamic panning effect, such as a fly-by (an object moving from one side to the other), a circling sound, or another spatial shift within the binaural field.

### Creative Goals

* Focus on spatial immersion through the use of stereo and binaural techniques.
* Use contrasting spaces or source types to create interest (e.g., a close, intimate voice recording alongside a wide, open stereo environment).
* Explore dynamic movement of sound within stereo and binaural fields to create a vivid auditory experience.
* Practice automation in Reaper to enhance your sound design.

### Submission Instructions

Submit the following materials to D2L:

**Project files and renders**

* Export your project as a one-minute audio or video file in WAV format.
* Consolidate your Reaper project and submit as a zipped folder.
* Use clear file naming (e.g., Lastname\_Firstname\_Project2.wav).

**Written response (about 300â€“400 words)**

* Describe the stereo microphone technique you chose and the sound source you recorded. Include a picture of your stereo microphone setup.
* Describe what you recorded with the Zoom H3-VR in binaural mode.
* Explain the panning automation moves you implemented and how you achieved the effects.
* Discuss how you used the Anaglyph plugin for binaural spatialization, including the parameters you adjusted and how they affected the sound.
* Reflect on any challenges you encountered and how you addressed them.
* Share any additional insights or interesting decisions in your creative process.
