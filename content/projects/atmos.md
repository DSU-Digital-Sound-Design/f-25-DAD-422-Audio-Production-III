title: "Atmos Mix"
---

## Project Overview

For this project, you will create a Dolby Atmos mix in Logic Pro X. You have two options for source material:

1. [Aiguille Rouge – Bebe Grand](https://cambridge-mt.com/ms/mtk/#BabeGrand)
2. [The Film Lambs](https://dakotastateuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/tate_carson_dsu_edu/EcGU4cdZ10ZNiSfQi1nFA9MBwZY9WMR_pZnY7I5Nv0VkFg?e=NOo8Rt)


Your task is to configure the session for Dolby Atmos, differentiate between bed and object tracks, and produce a technically compliant and creatively engaging immersive mix.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

* Configure Logic Pro X for Dolby Atmos mixing at 24-bit / 48 kHz / 24 fps.
* Differentiate between bed tracks (static, ambient) and object tracks (dynamic, locative).
* Apply spatialization techniques to enhance immersion, narrative clarity, or musical impact.
* Meet Dolby Atmos loudness and technical delivery standards.
* Deliver a finished mix in both Logic Pro project format and ADM BWF format.

## Creative Expectations

* Allocate tracks intentionally to beds or objects based on their role in the mix.
* Use at least four object tracks with panning automation that includes a variety of movement types (e.g., lateral, vertical, front-to-back).
* Ensure spatial decisions serve the arrangement’s clarity, emotional tone, or storytelling.
* Maintain a cohesive balance between static and moving elements to avoid listener fatigue.

## Project Setup

### Session Configuration

1. **Set Project Audio Format**

   * Go to `Preferences -> Audio` and set I/O to **24-bit, 48 kHz, 24 fps**.

2. **Enable Spatial Audio**

   * Navigate to `Project Settings -> Audio -> General`.
   * Under “Spatial Audio,” select **Dolby Atmos**.
   * Set “Surround Format” to **7.1.2**.

3. **Bed Tracks**

   * Use the Surround Panner for static, ambient, or foundational elements.

4. **Object Tracks**

   * Use the 3D Object Panner for moving elements or those requiring strong locative presence.
   * Automate movement to support creative goals.

5. **Monitoring**

   * Monitor in **7.1.4** via the Dolby Atmos Renderer plugin.

## Mixing Guidelines

* Use panning automation on at least four object tracks, varying motion type and speed.
* Avoid stereo panning modes for object tracks—use full spatial controls for Atmos authenticity.
* On your Master track, meter **after** the Dolby Atmos Renderer plugin. Match Dolby Atmos standards of **-18 LUFS-I** and **-1 dBTP**.

## Submission Requirements

Submit the following:

1. Logic Pro X project folder with all media included.
2. ADM BWF export of your final mix.
3. Written reflection (1–2 paragraphs) addressing:

   * Your approach to bed vs. object allocation.
   * The reasoning behind your spatial automation choices.
   * Any technical challenges and how you solved them.

## Holistic Rubric (60 points total)

**Exceeds Expectations (54–60 points / 90–100%)**

* Fully compliant technical setup and loudness standards.
* Spatialization choices are immersive, varied, and serve the mix’s creative goals.
* Seamless integration of beds and objects.
* Reflection is thorough, connecting technical decisions to creative outcomes.
* All files are complete, organized, and functional.

**Meets Expectations (48–53 points / 80–89%)**

* Minor technical or loudness issues that do not significantly affect playback.
* Spatialization is generally effective with some creative intent.
* Beds and objects are mostly well-integrated.
* Reflection addresses key prompts but lacks depth in some areas.
* Files are complete with minor organizational issues.

**Approaches Expectations (42–47 points / 70–79%)**

* Technical setup mostly correct but with occasional errors in format or loudness.
* Spatialization is functional but not consistently purposeful.
* Integration of beds and objects is uneven.
* Reflection is minimal or vague.
* Files are submitted but may be poorly organized.

**Below Expectations (36–41 points / 60–69%)**

* Noticeable technical errors in setup or loudness.
* Spatialization choices are inconsistent, ineffective, or distracting.
* Poor integration of beds and objects.
* Reflection is incomplete or fails to address major prompts.
* Missing or disorganized files.

**Far Below Expectations (0–35 points / 0–59%)**

* Incorrect technical setup or failure to meet loudness standards.
* Minimal or absent spatialization.
* No meaningful integration of beds and objects.
* Reflection missing or lacking substance.
* Submission incomplete, nonfunctional, or disorganized.
