This course introduces students to the principles and practices of spatial audio and immersive sound design through a hands-on, project-based approach. Beginning with foundational concepts in acoustics and the physical properties of sound, students progress through stereo, binaural, ambisonic, and multichannel formats, gaining experience with both historical and contemporary spatial audio technologies. Alongside technical instruction in recording, mixing, and software tools such as Reaper and the Ambisonic Toolkit, the course incorporates critical listening, collaborative critique, and exploration of spatial aesthetics in music, sound art, and cinema. Through progressively complex projects—including mono sound design, stereo/binaural recording, ambisonic mixing, and Dolby Atmos production—students develop the technical fluency and creative sensibility necessary to craft engaging, multidimensional soundscapes for artistic, cinematic, and interactive media contexts.
