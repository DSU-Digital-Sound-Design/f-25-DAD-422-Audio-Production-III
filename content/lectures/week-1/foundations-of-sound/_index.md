## Fundamentals of Sound

![](https://www.healthyhearing.com/uploads/images/the-basics-of-hearing-hh19.jpg)

{{% note %}}
- The study of sound is a multidisciplinary field.
  - It explores physical aspects, such as vibrations and waves.
  - It considers physiological factors, like the construction of the ear.
  - It examines perceptual elements, including auditory sensations.
- This field links physical, physiological, and perceptual frames of reference.
  - It investigates how these aspects interact to create auditory perceptions.
- Cognitive Psychology of Sound extends this study.
  - It looks at how we organize sonic perceptions into meaningful wholes.
  - It provides evidence for how we interpret and evaluate sound and sound structures.
- A "frame of reference" is a set of concepts and definitions accepted by a particular field.
  - It represents a specific worldview within that area of study.

## Key Acoustics Fields

- Physical Acoustics: Examines sound generation and transmission.
- Physiological Acoustics: Explores ear processing and auditory sensations.
- Signal Processing: Focuses on electronic and mathematical sound representations.

{{% note %}}
- In our study of sound, we will explore several key fields of acoustics.

- Physical Acoustics focuses on the generation, transmission, and modification of acoustic waves.
  - We ask: How is sound produced and influenced by materials and construction?
  - How does sound transmission through air change what we hear?
  - What are the physical foundations of our emotional responses to sound?
  - We will touch on Musical, Architectural, and Environmental Acoustics.

- Physiological Acoustics examines how the human body reacts to sound vibrations.
  - We consider: How do our ears process and transform acoustic energy into sensations?
  - What are the physiological roots of our emotional responses to sound?
  - Together, Physical and Physiological Acoustics form the basis of Psychoacoustics.

- Signal Processing and Notation look at sound through electronic, graphic, and mathematical representations.
  - We explore: How does manipulating symbols relate to manipulating sound itself?
  - What is the formal basis for our emotional responses to sound?
  - In this course, we will focus on basic graphic representations, such as sound signals and spectra, and on understanding digital audio fundamentals.

## Sound, Noise, and Music

- Sound: Vibrational energy perceived as auditory sensations.
- Noise: Unpleasant or unintended sound within a context.
- Music: Temporally organized sound and silence, communicating intention.
  - Music involves interaction among composer, performer, and listener.

{{% note %}}
- Understanding what constitutes sound, noise, and music is essential as we move into more complex audio environments where these elements intertwine.
- In immersive audio formats, distinguishing between desired sounds (music) and unwanted sounds (noise) is crucial for creating clear, engaging soundscapes.

## Noise

- Definition: Non-periodic sound with flat spectral distributions.
- Contextual Example: Noise Music as an art form.

{{% note %}}
- In advanced audio design, especially with surround sound, managing noise is critical to ensuring a clean and immersive experience.
- Technologies like Dolby Atmos are designed to minimize unwanted noise and enhance the clarity and placement of intentional sounds.
- This example demonstrates how noise can be used creatively in certain musical contexts.

## Music: A Temporal Art Form

- Music: Organized sound and silence, communicating without direct reference.
- Emphasis on temporal and communicative aspects.
- Interaction: Composer, performer, and listener shape the music experience.

{{% note %}}
- In immersive audio formats like Dolby Atmos, music is often treated as a dynamic, evolving soundscape rather than a static piece, enhancing the listener's engagement.
- The temporal and spatial organization of music in surround sound systems adds a new dimension to how music is experienced, making the interaction between composer, performer, and listener even more critical.

## Immersive Audio Technologies

### Dolby Atmos
- Object-based audio format
- Allows for precise placement of sound in a 3D space
- Enhances depth and realism in audio experiences

### Ambisonics
- Full-sphere surround sound technique
- Captures and reproduces sound field using spherical harmonics
- Offers flexibility in playback systems

{{% note %}}
- These technologies represent the cutting edge of immersive audio experiences.
- We'll delve deeper into their workings and applications in later sessions.

## Practical Examples

- Now we'll listen to some 5.1 surround sound, Dolby Atmos, and Ambisonics demos.

{{% note %}}
- This example will give you a sense of how the concepts we're covering today are applied in real-world projects. 
- Understanding the fundamentals will allow you to think critically about how to use sound to tell stories and create immersive experiences.
- Pay attention to how different formats affect your perception of space and sound placement.
